Developed as part of the [NUS Makerthon 2020](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/makerthon2020/), aUSm aspires to help families and friends of people with autism better connect with society.

## Background

The term *autism* comes from the Greek word *autos*, meaning *self*. It describes conditions where one is removed from social interaction, becoming an *isolated self*. Autism is a developmental condition leading to difficulty in communication and interactions with other people. Is is estimated that one in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder

With aUSm, our target audience is families with autistic children. After much research on the experiences of such families, we have identified 3 key difficulties faced by children with autism and their families in public:

- Social stigma from causing public nuisance
- Meltdowns in public are faced with stares and judgement from passerbys
- Extra supervision of the autistic child is required when bringing the family out for activities

## Aim

The aim of aUSm is to:

- Help families and friends discover autism-friendly places so as to encourage outdoor activities
- Foster communities where families with autistic children can come together for support
- Reduce the social stigma against autism

## Functions

aUSm is a collection of functions that aims to make venturing into the public a better experience for families with autistic children.

#### GPS Tracker

Through the use of a wearable device in the form of a wristband, the location of the child with autism is transmitted in real-time to the application. The wristband comes equipped with GPS and mobile data functionality, thus allowing it to operate as an independent device. This gives families peace of mind as they will be able to easily locate their child in the event that their child runs off. In future iterations of the wristband, it is possible to have it monitor the heart rate of the wearer so as to detect impending meltdowns.

#### Community Rating

A review system that is targeted towards families with autistic children. In addition to the typical rating and feedback, there are categorical ratings which help users to ascertain how noisy and crowded a place is. This is a huge help to families whose children have sensory processing disorder and are sensitive to stimuli.
